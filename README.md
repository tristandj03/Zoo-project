# Zoo-project
Framework exploring environmental and enclosure impacts on zoo animal welfare
This project is gonna explore how various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and enclosure characteristics influence welfare indicators in captive animals. I will be combining the use of data science and GIS to investigate real environmental data with behavior models to identify periods of increased stress risk and provide clear insights for welfare focused decision making. The end result should be an effective support tool which complements animal care expertise.

Focus species: Lions and Penguins

Planned Indicators:
- Heat Stress Risk index
- Resource Accessibility Index
- Activity Level Index
- Weather Exposure
- Visitor pressure index
- Retreat Access Index
WIill choose 5 of these
